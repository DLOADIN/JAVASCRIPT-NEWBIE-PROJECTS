# JAVASCRIPT-NEWBIE-PROJECTS

This repository chronicles my journey of learning **JavaScript** from scratch. It includes various exercises, small projects, and a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors game** that I built along the way. Additionally, it showcases exercises on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, which I practiced to strengthen my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of JavaScript.

## Overview

This repository serves as a record of my progress while learning JavaScript. It starts from the basics, gradually introducing more complex concepts, and ends with a practical implementation of these learnings through mini-projects and exercises in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. 

I built a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game as part of my first project, demonstrating the use of JavaScript functions, conditionals, and DOM manipulation. Alongside, I worked on DSA exercises to better understand algorithmic thinking and problem-solving using JavaScript.

## Learning Journey

### From Basics to Projects
- **Understanding Variables and Data Types**: Covered the basics of declaring variables, working with different data types, and understanding scope and hoisting.
- **Functions and Conditionals**: Gained proficiency in writing reusable code with functions, utilizing conditionals (`if-else`, `switch` statements) to control program flow.
- **Loops and Iterations**: Explored different types of loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) to manage iterations and manipulate arrays or objects.
- **JavaScript DOM Manipulation**: Learned how to select, modify, and interact with HTML elements using JavaScript.

## Projects

### Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple interactive **Rock, Paper, Scissors game** where a user plays against the computer. The game uses basic JavaScript functionality like:
- **Event listeners** to capture user input.
- **Random number generation** for the computer's choice.
- **Conditionals** to determine the winner based on game rules.
- **DOM manipulation** to update the webpage with game results.

You can play the game by selecting one of the three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the system will output whether you won, lost, or drew against the computer.

### DSA and Algorithms Exercises

Alongside learning JavaScript, I focused on improving my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). These exercises helped me gain insight into:
- **Arrays**: Learning how to manipulate and traverse arrays effectively.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementing basic sorting algorithms such as **bubble sort**, **selection sort**, and **insertion sort**.
- **Recursion**: Understanding the concept of recursive functions through exercises like calculating the factorial of a number.
- **Big O Notation**: Grasping the importance of time and space complexity when writing efficient code.

#### Key Exercises:
- **Palindrome Checker**: A function that checks if a string is a palindrome.
- **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**: A function to generate the nth Fibonacci number.
- **Binary Search Algorithm**: Implementing binary search for efficient lookups.

## Technologies

This project uses:
- **JavaScript**: The primary language for all the exercises and projects.
